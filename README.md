# README

This is a basic application created to explore the use of MS SQL Server.

It was generated by:
`rails new r6sqlserver --database=sqlserver`

To get all dependencies setup you should be able to run:
`bin/setup`

However for the record this does two main things:
1. Installs freetds (via brew), which is the database driver of SQL Server.
2. Sets some bundler build flags, which ensure that the tiny_tds gem can actually
   find the brew libraries.
   `bundle config set build.tiny_tds --with-freetds-dir="\$(brew --prefix freetds)"`


## Setting up the server

We're going to be setting up a server using Docker. This is mostly reproducing
the instructions from here:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/developer-get-started/ruby/mac/?rtc=1

1. Download Docker https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/
2. Install it
3. You'll need to temporarily elevate your privileges through self service,
   and will likely need to ask systems to enable this for you. This prompt will
   happen the first time you run 'Docker'
3. Increase the available memory for docker to at least 4GB:

   - Right click the docker icon in the menu bar
   - Preferences
   - Resources
   - Memory
   - Apply and restart

4. `docker pull microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-latest`
5. With a password in place of yourStrong(!)Password: `docker run -e 'HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING=1' -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=yourStrong(!)Password' -p 1433:1433 -d microsoft/mssql-server-linux`
6. We're done! Now you just need to create the database:
`SA_PASSWORD=yourStrong(!)Password bundle exec rake db:create`

Probably a better way of handling the password there. I might be overlooking something, but it just seems to be
protecting the SQL server database in your local docker cluster, which I *assume* is only accessible from
localhost. No not sure why they put emphasis on its security.
