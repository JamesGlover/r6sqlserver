# README

This is a basic application created to explore the use of MS SQL Server.

It was generated by:
`rails new r6sqlserver --database=sqlserver`

To get all dependencies setup you should be able to run:
`bin/setup`

However for the record this does two main things:
1. Installs freetds (via brew), which is the database driver of SQL Server.
2. Sets some bundler build flags, which ensure that the tiny_tds gem can actually
   find the brew libraries.
   `bundle config set build.tiny_tds --with-freetds-dir="\$(brew --prefix freetds)"`
